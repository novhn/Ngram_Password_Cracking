Variables:
---------

1. Ngrams with probability 0
  -We should use only the ngrams that exist. 
2. Ngram length
  -Bigram versus Trigram. No Unigram.
3. Number of passwords cracked
  -Currently a constant of 100
4. Training data itself
  -Which data do we use?
  -Do we include the frequencies?

Outputs
---------
1. Time to crack (TTC for number of passwords)

Not a variable:
-----------
1. Password length (limit to 8 for now)
  -We are finding all of the short passwords first

John:
-----
1. Examine the github password list (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords)
and look for the frequency of bad passwords in order to better weight the ngram models
2. Categorize training data


Wesley:
------

Questions:
----------
1. Should we consider training the data along with the frequencies?
2. Should we consider making the HMM additive, that is to say, incorporate multiple lists?
3. How much time should be spent on the HMM?
