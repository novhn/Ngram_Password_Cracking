Variables:
---------

1. Ngrams with probability 0
2. password length (limit to 8 for now)
3. time to crack (limit to TTC for 50 passwords)
4. frequency of bad passwords as a part of training data


John:
-----
1. Hold Length to 8 and TTC to 50 passwords
DONE - 2. Examine the github password list (https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords)
and look for the frequency of bad passwords in order to better weight the ngram models
3. Tinker with ngram probabilities that are 0, and whether to keep them

Wesley:
------
1. Hold password length to 8
2. Examine the time to crack 50 passwords versus 10 minutes

Questions:
----------
1. Should we consider training the data along with the frequencies?
2. Should we consider making the HMM additive, that is to say, incorporate multiple lists?
3. How much time should be spent on the HMM?
